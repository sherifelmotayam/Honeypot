# Honeypot
A honeypot is basically an instrument for information gathering and learning. A honeypot is an information system resource whose value lies in the unauthorized or illicit use of that resource. More generally a honeypot is a trap set to divert or discover attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Essentially, honeypots are resources that allow anyone or anything to access it and add production value. Honeypots do not have any unprotected, unused workstation on a network being closely watched by administrators. The focus lies on a silent collection of as much information as possible about their attack patterns, used programs, and the black hat community itself. All this information is used to learn more about the black hat proceedings and motives, as well as their technical knowledge and abilities. This is just a primary purpose of a honeypot. There are a lot other possibilities for a honeypotdivert hackers from productive systems or seize a hacker while conducting an attack are just two possible examples.

<br/>
The two main reasons why honeypots are deployed are:<br/>
1) To learn how intruders probe and attempt to gain access to your systems and gain insight into attack methodologies to better protect real production systems.</br>
2) To gather forensic information required to aid in the apprehension or prosecution of intruders.

 # Scope
 Monitoring the network traffic:<br/>
Our system will be able to gather information such as (IP, OS, Timestamp, visited pages, ...) about the visitor when he/she visits the web application.

Determine malicious traffic:<br/>
After monitoring all traffic, the system will be able to determine if there is any threat such as SQL injection and Brute Force.

Divert attacker to fabricated data:<br/>
If there is any threat found, the system shall be able to lure the attacker automatically by diverting him to the fabricated data.

Monitor attacks behavior:<br/>
While the attacker is in the fabricated data zone, Our system shall be able to determine his behavior to get our security issue or hole in our system.
