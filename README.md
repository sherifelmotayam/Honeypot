# Attacks on the internet keep on increasing and it causes harm to our security system. In order to minimize this threat, it is necessary to have a security System that has the ability to detect every day attacks and prevent them. "Honeypot is one of the proactive defense technologies, in which resources placed in a network with the aim to observe and capture new attacks". This proposal introduces a honeypot-based model for intrusion detection systems (IDS) which enable the system to monitor attacker behavior. The capabilities and the limitations of honeypots will be introduced and needed improvement will be identified, we aim to use this trend for early attack prevention so that pre-emptive action is taken before unexpected harm to our security system. The majority of IT security teams will benefit from this project because it will assist them in making their systems more safe. Honeypots, as previously noted, are an important component of today's cyber security arsenals. The success of this project will be determined by whether or not the script works, the number of threats it prevents, and the amount of information gained about attackers using this Honeypot.
